        # Note: Without signing config, this generates app-release-unsigned.apk or similar, 
        # which cannot be installed directly. 
        # But 'flutter build apk --release' often uses debug signing by default if not configured? 
        # Actually no, release build requires signing config for installation.
        # Let's build debug apk as well for easy testing.
